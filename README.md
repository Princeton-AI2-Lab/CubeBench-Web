# CubeBench Project Page

This is the project page for **CubeBench: Diagnosing Interactive, Long-Horizon Spatial Reasoning under Partial Observations**.

## Overview

CubeBench is a novel generative benchmark centered on the Rubik's Cube, designed to evaluate Large Language Model (LLM) agents' capabilities in:
- **Spatial Reasoning**: Understanding 3D geometry and action consequences
- **Long-Horizon State Tracking**: Maintaining and updating world models over long sequences
- **Active Exploration under Partial Observation**: Constructing complete mental models from limited views

## Key Features

- **Three-Tiered Diagnostic Framework**: Progressive evaluation from full symbolic state to partial visual observations
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Tested on leading LLMs including GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and more
- **Critical Findings**: Uniform 0.00% pass rate on all long-horizon tasks across all models

## Structure

The website is built using the [Academic Project Page Template](https://github.com/eliahuhorwitz/Academic-project-page-template) and includes:

- **Abstract**: Overview of the research problem and contributions
- **Three Core Challenges**: Visualization of the cognitive challenges
- **CubeBench Framework**: Detailed explanation of the three-tiered diagnostic framework
- **Key Results**: Comprehensive experimental results from three diagnostic experiments
- **BibTeX Citation**: For easy reference
